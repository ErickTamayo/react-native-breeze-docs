# Variants

As Breeze uses a responsive design approach, similarly, you can use the built-in variants to apply specific styles given one or multiple conditions.

### Platform

Adding `ios:`, `android:`, `macos:`, `windows:`, `web:`, or `native:` prefix, only applies that style to that specific platform.

```jsx
// This will apply red background to iOS platforms
// and green to every other platform

<View style={br`bg-green-500 ios:bg-red-500`} />
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<Note>

The `native:` variant is the equivalent to `ios:` and `android:` variants together. This is specially useful if you need to apply a style of devices only.

</Note>


### Orientation

Adding `landscape:` or `portrait:` prefix, will apply styles when the devices is in that orientation:

```jsx
// This will apply red background to iOS platforms
// and green to every other platform

<View style={br`landscape:w-16 portrait:w-32`} />
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<Note>

The orientation variant only works for iOS or Android devices, but you can set a default for non devices like the following:

`` br`w-8 landscape:w-16 portrait:w-32` ``

</Note>


### Hover

You can add the `hover:` prefix to only apply a style on hover

```jsx
<View style={br`bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-600`} />
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<Note>

This only works when using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web)

</Note>


### Focus

You can add the `focus:` prefix to only apply a style on hover

```jsx
<TextInput style={br`bg-gray-200 focus:bg-white`} />
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<Note>

This only works for `<TextInput />` components

</Note>


## Variant Interactions

You can combine multiple variants to be able to apply styles under certain conditions. The following convention gives you an idea what you can do:

`platform:media:variant:style`

** This means you can use the following combinations: **

Apply `bg-gray-500` when platform is `ios`, screen is `md`, and `hover`:

```jsx simple
<View style={br`ios:sm:hover:bg-gray-500`} />
```

Apply `bg-gray-500` when platform is `ios` and screen is `md`:

```jsx simple
<View style={br`ios:sm:bg-gray-500`} />
```

Apply `bg-gray-500` when platform is `ios` and `hover`:

```jsx simple
<View style={br`ios:hover:bg-gray-500`} />
```

Apply `bg-gray-500` screen is `md` and on `hover`:

```jsx simple
<View style={br`md:hover:bg-gray-500`} />
```

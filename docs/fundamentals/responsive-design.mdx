# Responsive Design

Every Style in Breeze can be applied conditionally at different widths. This is mostly useful when using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) to build responsive interfaces without extra effort.

We currently have the same defaults as Tailwind.

```js filename=breeze.config.js
// Breakpoints
// Points when using devices (iOS, Android).
// Pixels when using React Native Web

{
  sm: 640,
  md: 768,
  lg: 1024,
  xl: 1280,
}
```

Following the same principles of Tailwind, you add the utility to take a certain effect at certain breakpoint from default to the biggest width:

```jsx
// Default 16 width, 32 on medium screens,
// and 48 on large screens

<View style={br`w-16 md:w-32 lg:2-48`} />
```

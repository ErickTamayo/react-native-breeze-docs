# Aspect Ratio

Utilities to control the aspect ratio of a Component.

| Style   | Properties           |
| :------ | :------------------- |
| ratio-1 | `{ aspectRatio: 1 }` |

Aspect ratio controls the size of the undefined dimension of a node. Aspect ratio is a non-standard property only available in React Native and not CSS.

- On a node with a set width/height, aspect ratio controls the size of the unset dimension
- On a node with a set flex basis, aspect ratio controls the size of the node in the cross axis if unset
- On a node with a measure function, aspect ratio works as though the measure function measures the flex basis
- On a node with flex grow/shrink, aspect ratio controls the size of the node in the cross axis if unset
- Aspect ratio takes min/max dimensions into account

## Configuration

```js
// breeze.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      aspectRatio: {
        "16-9": 1.7777777778, // 16:9
      },
    },
  },
};
```
